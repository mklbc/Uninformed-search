# Uninformed-search

1. Problem Definition
In this assignment, I implemented various uninformed search algorithms—Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), Iterative Deepening Search (IDS), Depth-Limited Search (DLS), and Bidirectional Search—in Python. The objective was to apply these algorithms to a defined search problem, measure their performance in terms of execution time and the number of nodes visited, and compare their efficiencies.
